I"„<p>I didnâ€™t want an entire year to go by without writing a post, so I thought that I would talk a little bit about a neat little tool I found for displaying grid data in ASP.NET MVC 5 projects. Itâ€™s called <a href="http://mvcgrid.net/" title="MVCGrid.Net">MVCGrid.Net</a>. I say â€œneat little tool,â€ but itâ€™s actually quite powerful now that I know more about how to use it.</p>
