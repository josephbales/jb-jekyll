<p>Well, I just spent two hours of my life getting a project running that was already working on another PC. Iâ€™m so fed up right now that I donâ€™t really want to work on the actual project. It is an ASP.NET Core 1.0 project that Iâ€™ve been working on a few minutes at a time for the past couple of months. Iâ€™ve made so little progress that when I started running into trouble I thought about just creating a new project from scratch and copying over the files. But without a guarantee that the new project would work I decided that was not a very good solution.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s actually been a few months since Iâ€™ve messed with the project. It builds and runs on my laptop, but I just built a new desktop computer and I have been doing most of my work on it, so I wanted to get the project going. I cloned it to the machine, restored the packages, and immediately ran into problems.</p>

<p>The first thing I ran into was that the .Net Core SDK doesnâ€™t get installed with Visual Studio 2015, mmmmkay. I installed that. Then the project wonâ€™t build. Turns out there were some new packages I needed that didnâ€™t get included in my project.json, so I added those. Mind you this is the same project.json file that worked fine on my laptop. Then I spent several minutes figuring out how to get the <code class="highlighter-rouge">dotnet user-secrets</code> command working. This one was also a missing reference in my project.json. This also didnâ€™t work on the laptop although it must have at some point in the past, otherwise I would not have been able to add my secret keys to it.</p>

<p>I re-ran across the problem where if you are running the project with IIS Express and SSL in debugging mode, it wonâ€™t work until you create the self-signed certificate. It doesnâ€™t throw an error or anything, the page just never loads. Using CTRL+F5 to start the project will get the pop-up you need to create the cert.</p>

<p>Finally, I ran across a bug where EF migrations canâ€™t deal with the boilerplate code created for use with Microsoft Identity. I had to go in and manually edit the migration code to give some fields maxlengths so that they could be used as indexes. Crazy.</p>

<p>So far my experience with .NET Core has just been one thing after another like this. The tooling is standing in the way of my coding. Honestly Iâ€™m not even sure why they released .NET Core 1.0 while the tooling was still officially in preview. I mean, the tooling is still in preview 3 months later and still seems to need some work.</p>

<p>I like the ideas behind .NET Core, but Iâ€™m thinking it has been a bit rushed. One of the things that really sets the Microsoft stack apart from others is how solid and cohesive it has been. I hope they can pull this shit together and get it shored up in the next few months.</p>

<p>Also, while Iâ€™m ranting about Microsoft products, let me just say that their sculpt keyboard and mouse combo is not great.
