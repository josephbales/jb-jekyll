I"*<p>I used to be a Google fanboy (my wife is still a Google fangirl). I used to sing their praises and recommend their software and services to anyone who asked for the slightest computer advice. But lately Iâ€™ve been rethinking my stance on Google and have started moving in other directions.</p>
