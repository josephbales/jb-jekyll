title: More De-Googling

Way back in 2014 I [wrote a post]({% post_url 2014-05-17-why-im-no-longer-a-google-fanboy %}) about no longer being a Google fanboy. Over the last 9 years I've waffled on this a bit. I briefly dipped my toe into the Microsoft ecosystem, but found it lacking (and it's still lacking to this day). So I gradually drifted back into the Google ecosystem for most of my needs.

Then last month, I learned that Google was doing away with yet another service that I really enjoyed, Google Domains. It's where I had all my domains registered. It had very affordable prices and some good features like email forwarding that I used quite a bit. But Google did what they do best and they decided to get rid of it. At least this time they aren't shutting it down completely, but are selling it to Squarespace. Since I have no interest in becoming a Squarespace customer right now, I decided to move my domains to another provider. After a brief and ironic Google search, I found what I was looking for in [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com).

This also got me to thinking about what else I can do to "de-Google" my life.
